Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

检验回文字符串，忽略非字母字符，空的字符串是回文。
先去除非字母字符，再检验是否是回文。

注意，除了字母，数字也是有效的，大小写也是任意的。
